// PYTHON DATA TYPES
- Data types are a classification of data items, it helps inform us of the kind of 
operations that can be performed on a particular data

common data types in python include:
    - Numeric (Integers, Floats)
    - Sequence (string, lists, tuples)
    - Boolean (True, False)
    - Sets
    - Dictionary

Numeric Data types:
This refers to data types that have a numeric value and could be any of the following:
    - integers: value respresented by the int class, could be positive or negative whole numbers
        usually without a fraction or a decimal 6, 23, -2

    - floats: value represented by float class, could also be positive or negative,
        it is specified by a decimal point e.g. 5.34, 10.21

    - complex numbers: Complex number is represented by complex class.
     It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example â€“ 2+3j

You can carry out operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them 
 

Sequence 
This refers to a collection of similar data types, sequences allow to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion
and includes the following:
    - strings: a sequence unicode characters,'', "", """"""
        -string indexing and string slicing, strings are immutable
    - lists: An ordered sequence of items, usually enclosed within []. They are mutable
    - tuples: Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. 


Boolean
Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.
Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). 

Set
In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.


Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types hold any 
single value as an element.



Python keywords to note when dealing with data types:
- int, float, set, string, tuple, list, complex, dict, bool
- type()
- dir()


// Python naming conventions
- Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
- Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Variable names follow the same convention as function names.


// How to debug in python
1. Read traceback bottom up
2. Check for the kind of error your code is throwing e.g. syntax errors, end of line
3. Check for the line the error is on
4. Fix it
